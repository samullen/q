# q

`q` is a command line to easily add items to a text file, or list the items
which are already there. 

Example:

```
% q
Take Samantha to Soccer
Pick up dinner
Do that thing at that place with that person
```

There's nothing exciting about this tool, just an easy way to get the stray
thoughts that cross your mind out of your head and into a file somewhere.

## Installation

Current installation is very basic. Once you've cloned the repository–and we're
assuming you have Elixir installed–run the following command:

```
mix escript.build
```

This will create the `q` executable which you can then copy to whatever
directory you want.

## Note on Patches/Pull Requests

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with mix.exs file, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but
   bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
